## Installation

You can install the released version of aphylo2 from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("aphylo2")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("USCbiostats/aphylo2")
```
## Example

```{r}
library(aphylo2)

# Preparing data
annotations <- list(
  c(0, 0, 1, 9, 9, 9),
  c(1, 1, 9, 0, 9, 9),
  c(1, 9, 0, 1, 9, 9)
)

geneid   <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5)
parentid <- c(4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6)

# Building the model
amodel <- new_model(annotations, geneid, parentid)

invisible({
  
  term_gains(amodel, 0:2)
  term_loss(amodel, 0:2)
  term_cogain(amodel, 0, 1)
  term_cogain(amodel, 0, 2)
  term_cogain(amodel, 1, 2)
  
  init(amodel)
  
})

# Testing
params <- c(
  # Gains
  .1, .1, .1,
  # Loss
  .1, .1, .1,
  # Co-gain
  .1, .1, .1,
  # Root probabilities
  .1, .1, .1
)

# Testing the likelihood
likelihood(amodel, params*0)

# Finding MLE
ans <- optim(params*0, function(f) {
  log(likelihood(amodel, f))
}, control = list(fnscale=-1, maxit = 2e3),
hessian = TRUE)

ans

# Root node probabilities
plogis(tail(ans$par, 3))

# Is it invertible?
diag(MASS::ginv(-ans$hessian))
# diag(solve(-ans$hessian, tol = 1e-100))
```
